## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] and deployed to GitHub pages.
I created this portfolio website using React to showcase my skills to potential employers. It's my very first website built with React and I'm still learning how to implement additional features to make it look much more professional. However, I believe so far it showcases the styling I like to express in my work: polished, organized and visually attractive.
As I keep improving my programming skills and building new applications I will be adding more projects and features.

## Mock-up

The following image shows a mock-up of the website appearance and functionality:
